In this subfolder we gather all button behaviour classes. Most of them are subclasses of the `AbstractButtonBehaviour` class which implements the visual behaviour of the 3D button object and wires the triggered event on button push to the specific `HandleButtonEvent()` method. This abstract method is implemented individually in each subclass, resulting in small subclasses only containing their `HandleButtonEvent()` implementation.
