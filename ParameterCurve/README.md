## Description

In universities and colleges, mathematical curves are often taught using analog materials like
paper and chalkboards. While these lessons are often supported by digital teaching concepts, they are often limited to passive visualizations like videos or images. A new, more active medium is made possible through virtual reality. This medium enables new learning techniques to promote understanding beyond raw mathematical formulas and increase spatial imagination in students. For this project, we took the materials of an existing college level math course and  developed a virtual reality application that visualizes single curves in 3D space and allows for user interaction with an imported set of curves.   



## Usage

The current project version contains a working data set of curves in with different views. Using the Unity Editor, the project can be viewed in its bare structure (resources, scripts,...). If you would like to see the application in action, there are currently two ways to do so:

- Using the [Vive Input Utility Simulator](https://github.com/ViveSoftware/ViveInputUtility-Unity/wiki/Simulator)  in the Unity editor

- Installing one of the provided [.apks](https://github.com/VRLAB-HSKL/Vektoranalysis/releases) on an [HTC Vive Focus Plus](https://business.vive.com/us/product/focus-plus/) or comparable android based VR headset

The simulator based method is the most accessible to users, because no physical headset is needed to experience the main functions of the application. Although as with all VR applications, this will always be a reduced experience when compared to running the application on a HMD.

If you have access to an android-based VR Headset, we have [.apks](https://github.com/VRLAB-HSKL/Vektoranalysis/releases) that can be installed on these devices. These releases were used during the college exercises in which the application was used in. The students were given [HTC Vive Focus Plus](https://business.vive.com/us/product/focus-plus/) devices, so all testing of the application was done on these devices. Other devices and platforms could be supported in the future if Unity is able to target them 😊

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")- What problem does it solve?- What did you learn?



## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)    ```







## Table of Contents (Optional)
If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
- [Installation](#installation)- [Usage](#usage)- [Credits](#credits)- [License](#license)
## Installation
What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
## Usage

## Credits
List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
## License
The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

🏆 The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.
## Badges
![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/lernantino/badmath)
Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features
If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
## How to Contribute
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
## Tests
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
