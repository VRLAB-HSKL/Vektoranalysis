  comment = {- transformed social interaction (tsi)
	- the ability of teachers and students to use digital technology to strategically alter their online representations and contexts in order to improve learning

- evidence from a series of empirical studies that demonstrate how breaking the social physics of traditional learning environments can increase learning in VEs

- taxonomies of VEs in general and previous implementations of learning systems in VEs

- An Immersive virtual environment (IVE) is one that perceptually surrounds the user, increasing his or her sense of presence or actually being within it.
	- characteristics
		- users are unobtrusively tracked physically as they interact with the IVE. User action such as head orientation and body position (i.e. gaze direction) are automatically and continually recorded, and the IVE, in turn, is updated to reflect the changes from these actions
		- sensory intormation from the physical world is kept to a minimum.

	- features
		- provides a wealth of information about the user of the IVE (body, gaze, ...)
		- designer of the ive has tremendous control over the user's experience and can alter the appearance and desin of the virtual world to fit experimental goals

	- limits (in 2008)
		- a long way to go before we have photographic or behavioral realism
		- some users of IVEs experiene simulator sicknesd
			- however, a recent longitudianl study has demonstrated that simulator sickness is extremly rare today

- Collaborative virtual environments (CVEs) involve more than a single user. CVE users interact via avatars

Approach 1: Create CVEs that reward activities performed offline
- Example: Quest Atlantis (2005)
	- mixed plattform, the VE provides a reward structure for tasks that largely need to be performed offline

Approach 2: Embed both the task and reward within the VE
- Example: River City Project (Clark & Dede, 2005)
	- multi-user VE for learning scientific principles and hypothesis testing built using design-based research
	- students interact with one another and the town's inhabitans via avatars using typed chat as they investigate and develop hypotheses regarding one of three strains of illness in the town.
	- the environment created an immersive experienmce that allowed students to become shapers of a scientific experience rather than passive observers
	- River City allowed students to shed a identity of a "student failing science" and take on the identity of a scientist
	- the immserive experience also encouraged critical thinking by actively engaging students

Approach 3: Leverage existing online environments instead of creating them from scratch
- Example: Collaboration of the university of california, los angeles with the childrens online environment Whyville (Foley & La Torre, 2004)
	- engineered a virtual pox epidemic in an attempt to increase awareness of and learning about epidemics and vaccinations.
	- the pox was spread by proximity and interaction
	- vaccinatios could be used to immunize against the poix, but a vaccination shortage (modeled from flu vaccine shortages in the real world) made it impossible for every user to be immunized
	- users infected with the pox would occasionally sneeze (replacing some of their typed chat) and spots would appear on their avatars face
	- researches found that the event led to a dramatic increase in users exploring the medical libraries in Whyville, and science topics in chat and message boards increased by 2000%


Unique affordances of VEs for Learning

- Embodied agents that teach and learn
	- create intelligent virtual agent who teach a learner about a specific domain
		- multiple examples of studies using this approach in article
	- work in this area has also explored virtual agents that encourage the construction rather than consumption of knowledge

- Co-learners
	- populate a virtual learning learning environment with virtual co-learners

- Visualizations
	- VEs can provide enhanced visualizations and a range of perspective into complex information (Salzman, Dede, Loftin & Chen, 1999)
	- For example, the ability to create, alter, and rotate structures in real time three dimension can make it easier to understand abstract concepts (Perdomo, Shiratuddin, Thabet & Ananth, 2005)
	- VEs also provide the ability to take on multiple perspectives of the same scenario. Studies have shwon that different perspectives make salient different aspects of the same environments (Ellis, Tharp, Grundwald & Smith, 1991, Thorndike & Hayes-Roth, 1982)
	- VEs can easily provide users with multiple perspectives on the same situation - central, peripheral, bird's-eye view, and so on - to make different aspects of the situation salient
	- VEs can provide not only visual cues but, with the integration of other technologies, haptic and auditory cues.

- Synthesis of archived behaviours

- Presence, immersion, and learning
	- presence: the degree to which the user actually feels if he or she is present in the VE (as opposed to present in the physical world)-
	- questionaire ratings

		- Held & Durlach, 1992

- TSI
	- Bailenson, 2006
	- Bailenson & Beall, 2006
	- Bailenson, Beall, Loomis, Blascovich & Turk, 2004

- First dimension of TSI: Self-representation
	- strategic decoupling of the rendered appearance or behaviors of avatars from the actual appearance or behavior of the humans driving the avatars
	- in a CVE, the teacher can be rendered differently to each type of student, tailoring his or her facial expressions to each student in order to maximize that student's attention and learning

- Second dimension of TSI: Transforming social-sensory abilities
	- complement human perceptual abilities
	- for example, teachers using virtual learning applications can utilize automatic registers that ensure they are spreading their attention equalle toward each student

- Third dimension of TSI: Social environment
	- the contextual setup of a virtual meeting room can be optimally configured for each participant
	- for example, while giving a speech in front of an audience, the speaker can replace the gestures of distracting students with gestures that improve the ability of that speaker to concentrate

  comment = {1.  Knowledge
- Recall
	- recall of specifics and universals
	- recall of methods and processes
	- recall of pattern. structure or setting
- Measurement
	- recall situation involves little more than bringing to mind the appropriate material

	- knowledge objectives emphasize most the psychological process of remembering
	- the process of relating is also involved in that a knowledge test situation requires the organization and reorganization of a problem such that it will furnish the appropriate signals and cues for the information and knowledge the individual posesses
		- if one thinks of the mind as a file, the problem in a knowledge test situation is that of finding in the problem or task the approriate signals, cues and clues which will most effectively bring out whatever knowledge is filled or stored

1.10 Knowledge of specifics
	- recall of specific and isolable bits of information.
	- the emphasis is on symbols with concrete referents
	- this material may be thought of as the elements from which more complex and abstract forms of knowledge are built

1.11 Knowledge of terminology
	- knowledge of the referents for specific symbols ( verbal and non-verbal )
	- this may include knowledge of the most generally accepted symbol referent, knowledge of the variety of symbols which may be used for a single referent, or knowledge of the referent most appropriate to a given use of a symbol

		- to define technical terms by giving their attributes, properties or relations
		- familiarity with a large number of words in their common range of meanings

1.12 Knowledge of specific facts
	- knowledge of dates, events, persons, places, etc.
	- this may include very precise and specific information such as the specific date or exact magnitude of a phenomenon
	- it may also include approximate or relative information such as an approximate time period or the general order of magnitude of a phenomenon
		- the recall of major facts about particular cultures
		- the posession of a minimum knowledge about the organisms studied in the laboratory

1.20 Knowledge of ways and means of dealing with specifics

- knowledge of the ways of organizing, studying, judging, and criticizing
- this includes the methods of inquiry, the chronological sequences and the standards of judgement within a field as well as the patterns of organization through which the areas of the fields themselves are determined and internally organized
- this knowledge is at an intermediate level of abstraction between specific knowledge on the one hand and knowledge of universals on the other. It does not so much demand the activity of the student in using the materials as it does a more passive awareness of their nature

1.21 Knowledge of conventions

- knowledge of characteristics ways of treating and presenting ideas and phenomena
- for purposes of communication and consistency, workers in a field employ usages, styles, practices, and forms which best suit their purposes and/or which appear to suit best the phenomena with which they deal
- it should be recognized that although these forms and conventions are likely to be set up on arbitrary, accidental, or authorative bases, they are retained because of the general agreement or concurrence of individuals concerned with the subject, phenomena, or problem

	- familiarity with the forms and conventions of the major types of works, e. g., verse, plays, scientific papers, etc.
	- to make pupils conscious of correct form and usage in speech and writing

1.22 Knowledge of trends and sequences

- Knowledge of the processes, directions. and movements of phenomena with respect to time

	- understanding of the continuity and development of american culture as exemplified in american life
	- knowledge of the basic trends underlying the development of public assistance programs

1.23 Knowledge of classifications and categories

- Knowledge are classes, sets, divisions, and arrangements which are regarded as fundamental for a give subject field, purpose, argument, or problem

	- to recognize the area encompassed by various kinds of problems or materials
	- becoming familiar with a range of types of literature

1.24 Knowledge of criteria

- Knowledge of the criteria by which facts, principles, opinions, and conduct are tested or judged
	- familiarity with criteria for judgement appropriate to the type of work and the purpose for which it is read
	- knowledge of criteria for the evaluation of recreational activities

1.25 Knowledge of methodology
- Knowledge of the methods of inquiry, techniques and procedures employed in a particular subject field as well as those employed in investigating particular problems and phenomena. The emphasis here is on the individual's knowledge of the method rather than his ability to use the method

	- knowledge of scientific methods for evaluating health concepts
	- the student shall know the methods of attack relevant to the kinds of problems of concern to the social sciences

1.30 Knowledge of the universals and abstractions in a field
- Knowledge of the major schemes and patterns by which phenomena and ideas are organized These are the large structures, theories and generalizations which dominate a subject field or which are quite generally used in studying phenomena or solving problems These are at the highest levels of abstraction and complexity

1.31 Knowledge of principles and generalizations},

  abstract   = {This study is a ten-year critical review of empirical research on the educational applications of Virtual Reality (VR). Results show that although the majority of the 53 reviewed articles refer to science and mathematics, researchers from social sciences also seem to appreciate the educational value of VR and incorporate their learning goals in Educational Virtual Environments (EVEs). Although VR supports multisensory interaction channels, visual representations predominate. Few are the studies that incorporate intuitive interactivity, indicating a research trend in this direction. Few are the settings that use immersive EVEs reporting positive results on users' attitudes and learning outcomes, indicating that there is a need for further research on the capabilities of such systems. Features of VR that contribute to learning such as first order experiences, natural semantics, size, transduction, reification, autonomy and presence are exploited according to the educational context and content. Presence seems to play an important role in learning and it is a subject needing further and intensive studies. Constructivism seems to be the theoretical model the majority of the EVEs are based on. The studies present real world, authentic tasks that enable context and content dependent knowledge construction. They also provide multiple representations of reality by representing the natural complexity of the world. Findings show that collaboration and social negotiation are not only limited to the participants of an EVE, but exist between participants and avatars, offering a new dimension to computer assisted learning. Little can yet be concluded regarding the retention of the knowledge acquired in EVEs. Longitudinal studies are necessary, and we believe that the main outcome of this study is the future research perspectives it brings to light.},

  abstract = {{Designers and evaluators of immersive virtual reality systems have many ideas concerning how virtual reality can facilitate learning. However, we have little information concerning which of virtual reality's features provide the most leverage for enhancing understanding or how to customize those affordances for different learning environments. In part, this reflects the truly complex nature of learning. Features of a learning environment do not act in isolation; other factors such as the concepts or skills to be learned, individual characteristics, the learning experience, and the interaction experience all play a role in shaping the learning process and its outcomes. Through Project Science Space, we have been trying to identify, use, and evaluate immersive virtual reality's affordances as a means to facilitate the mastery of complex, abstract concepts. In doing so, we are beginning to understand the interplay between virtual reality's features and other important factors in shaping the learning process and learning outcomes for this type of material. In this paper, we present a general model that describes how we think these factors work together and discuss some of the lessons we are learning about virtual reality's affordances in the context of this model for complex conceptual learning.}},

This paper seeks to highlight the various potencies which are hastening fundamental change within higher education, particularly with regard to the provision of continuing professional development. It encourages the adaptation of appropriate pedagogies designed specifically to facilitate technology-enhanced teaching and learning methodologies, reflecting the cognitive and collaborative learning modes of current and future learners. Ultimately, the evidential content suggests the necessity to embrace educational technological affordances in order to support the evolution of higher education.},
